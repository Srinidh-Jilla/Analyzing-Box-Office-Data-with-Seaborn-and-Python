# Analyzing-Box-Office-Data-with-Seaborn-and-Python
In this project, I worked with the The Movie Database (TMDB) Box Office Prediction data set. The motion picture industry is raking in more revenue than ever with its expansive growth the world over. Can we build models to accurately predict movie revenue? Could the results from these models be used to further increase revenue? I tried to answer these questions by the way of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this project and the next. The statistical data visualization libraries Seaborn and Plotly will be my workhorses to generate interactive, publication-quality graphs.
